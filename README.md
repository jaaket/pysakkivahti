# Pys√§kkivahti

A web application for displaying the schedule for a public transportation stop and line.

The application uses a GTFS (https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) feed file to acquire schedule information.
For Helsingin Seudun Liikenne, you can download the file from https://infopalvelut.storage.hsldev.com/gtfs/hsl.zip.
The location of the file needs to be provided as an environment variable.

## Dependencies

## Environment variables

| Variable name | Description |
